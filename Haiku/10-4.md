Going into the assignment, I had a pretty good idea of what to do. I remembered how to use pwd, ls, as well as cd, so I was able to navigate from my hard drive to my desktop, then to my github folder, to my repository, then to the Haiku folder.
Once I had confirmed I was in the Haiku folder, I didn't quite remember the exact command to create the .aiff file, so I looked at the demo png to get an idea of what to do.
I then used the -v command and typed in the poem I found about trees, then I used the -o command and named the file "ellenhaiku.aiff", and sent it to the Haiku folder.
Ellen's voice makes it somewhat difficult to make out the exact poem, so I included a png of my exact command line just in case.
