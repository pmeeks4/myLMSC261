1. For my final project, I plan to teach myself how to use A-Frame and html to create a playable VR experience. I'd like this to be something that I can share with the class so my goals are not only for it to be playable, but for it to be enjoyable.
2. This project forces me to learn html (although we are learning it in class, I'll still have to apply it further), and it gives me an oportunity to develop a VR game, which I'm very excited about. I'm often on the outside when it comes to video games, being the player up until recently, when I participated in my first game jam as a composer. But now I get to be a developer, which is very exciting.
3. In terms of code, I'm brand new to html, so I'm not sure yet what I'll need to borrow. However, I have found many helpful youtube videos to help learn the basics of using A-Frame, which I will link.

I'll also be using the A-Frame website, which I'll also link

To view my experience, I will personally be using my Oculus Quest 2, but to my knowlege, the experience should work or most platforms.
4. For this project, my audience is really just the class. I want to make something short but enjoyable and entertaining to present. However this opens up the door to future projects for me to develop even grander experiences and to share them online.
5. The first plot point on my timeline is my meeting with Rachel on Tuesday, November 16th. Once we talk about the project, I'll then have one more class before Thanksgiving break, so my plan is to take what I know about html from class on the 15th and class on the 22nd and begin to put together my experience from then until the week before it's due. I'd like to use that last week to send it out to people with VR headsets that I know can playtest it for me, because my goal is to be able to send it to the class and for it to work. In that time I might make small adjustments but the goal is for the experience itself to be finished.
6. I think this project should be assessed on whether the experience is playable and if I've used html correctly. It probably shouldn't be assesed on how enjoyable it is, despite that being one of my goals, because it's entertainment is subjective from player to player. Although, I would like to have someone other than myself play it for my presentation, and that can be assessed on whether there are any issues duing the demo of the experience.
