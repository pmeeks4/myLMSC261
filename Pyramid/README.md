I first tried to figure out what the i and j variables meant. I knew they had to be important somehow but I didn't know why yet. I took several attempts to understand the looping function, and tried to think of the function like a grid.
I made the program prompt the question of how tall the pyramid should be, then made it so that 2 if statements set the boundaries of the pyramid, quitting the program if it is too tall or too short.
After experimenting for a while, I kept getting errors and weird results, such as strange patterns made out of #. So I tried to get a little help from the internet, namely a website called "askpython.com", which is when I realized I needed to use a 3rd variable, k, to reverse the shape of the pyramid. Then it all started coming together.
I first tried setting k to "k = stacks - (stacks - 1)", which worked except it gave me the pyramid in the wrong direction. I was so close but I wasn't quite there yet. I saw the website had k set to "k = 2 * stacks - 2" so I tried it, and finally it worked.
