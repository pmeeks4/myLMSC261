The biggest issue faced was that my branch got behind a critical push from Johnny's branch, and from that point forward I wasn't able to fetch. It took a long time of fetching and trying to pull, but eventually I deleted my branch and created an new one based on Courtney's
I added my paragraph to the group, and I tried to add a sound file but it created a conflict and wouldn't upload no matter what I tried.
Johnny and Courtney were able to help me get back on track when my branch fell off. They helped explain how to merge the branches as well, putting our website together. Ran tried his best but couldn't figure out how to edit the website in the end.
